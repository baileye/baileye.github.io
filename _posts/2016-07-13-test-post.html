	<h1>Hi there, I'm Eoin Bailey!</h1>
	<p>Welcome to eb.ie, a site about me, Eoin Bailey, and some of the 
		projects that I work on. 
	</p>
	<p>
		If you want to see more details about me personally, head over to
		the <a href="/about">about</a> page.
	</p>
	<p>
		This site is my latest mini-project, it's hosted via Github Pages
		which I just wanted to try out. I'm using the Jekyll build system
		which seems quite good but a few things I need to figure out, 
		like how to make this into a blog...
	</p>
