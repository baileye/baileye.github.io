		I'm Writing this on a plane on my way to <a href="">SIGGRAPH 2016</a> in Anaheim. 
		This year <a href="http://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> (my employer) 
		has a booth, which is awesome! Last year several of us went out and
		met with software companies and got their pulse on what would help
		them enable rendering in the cloud. Over the past year we've been 
		working on making rendering on <a href="http://azure.com">Azure</a>
		a reality. I'm happy to say we have! 
	</p>
	<p>
		Working with a great team in Microsoft and amazing partners outside
		of Microsoft we've rendered some great scenes on <a href="http://azure.com/">Virtual Machines</a> 
		in Azure. I'm adding more detail to a document on Github that explains
		what we did and how anyone can replicate it: <a href="http://github.com/baileye/AzureCloudRender">Rendering on Azure Documentation</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you are at SIGGRAPH in Anaheim come by the Microsoft booth and 
		ask for me or one of my colleagues how you can get started rendering
		on Azure!
