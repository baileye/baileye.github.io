	<h1>Trans Rockies Run</h1>
	<p>
		My little brother and his wife completed the <a href="">Trans Rockies Run</a>
		this month. This race is 6 days over the Rocky mountains, at high altitude, 
		covering 200 kilometres, but does have a hot shower truck for the end of each
		day, which sounds amazing! He <a href="https://medium.com/@HereToRun/and-were-back-on-for-the-rocky-mountains-5580601a87bd#.cw66ssetu">
		wrote up their experience</a>, it's well worth a read, a key question they 
		discovered was: 
		<br>
		<em>‘what temperature is it in a tent at 10,000 ft elevation at 3a.m. in Colorado?’</em>
