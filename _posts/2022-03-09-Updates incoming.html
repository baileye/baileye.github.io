	<p>
		After being very slow to update this site I'm going to do more soon!
	</p>

	<p>
		One idea to encourage me to do it more, is to make more edits using 
		Codespaces and also Github.dev (using the '.' shortcut when in a repo).
	</p>
	<p>
		In fact, what happens if I try to embed the editor in a page...
