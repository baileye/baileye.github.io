		<a href="https://github.dev">GitHub.dev</a> is an awesome feature of GitHub 
		that everyone should know about for those times that need to make a quick edit
		to a few files in their browser. By either replacing <em>.com</em> with <em>.dev</em>
		in the URL of their repo or pressing '.' (that's a full-stop or period depending
		on your preference) in the browser when at your repo, your repo will open in 
		an in-browser Visual Studio Code session.
