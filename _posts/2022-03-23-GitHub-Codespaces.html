	<p>
		GitHub Codespaces is like GitHub.dev on steroids. While GitHub.dev lets you edit your repo
		in your browser, Codespaces is your own personal cloud-based development environment. 
		I'm still only playing around with it, but I can see how it has potential to be a very powerful
		tool. 
	</p>
	<p>
		At a super-high level view I would say it's a bit like containers, but for a whole development
		environment. It lets you configure the environment for all your users, while still allowing indiviual
		customisations. A new team member can have their own Codespace on day one, with access to 
		the default team settings, configs, build tools, etc... 
	</p>
	<p>
		I need to think some more about how I will use this for my own projects, but on a team level
		it's a definite win!
