    About me: Eoin Bailey!
  </h1>
  <p>I'm a software engineer at Microsoft, working mostly with the cloud. I've been working 
    on and with internet and cloud technologies for a over a decade, it's been fun! Generally
    on this page stuff I've worked on will be in reverse chronological order, but I 
    guarantee nothing.

  <p>
    Right now I'm working at Microsoft on Azure. I work with Independent Software Vendors (ISV)
    so that they can run natively on the cloud, sometimes that means Virtual Machines so it
    looks similar to how they run on-premises right now, and sometimes it means rewriting
    code to integrate with Platform services (PaaS) on Azure.
